**Objective: Get familar with the order parts and start testing different motor speeds**

Now that the motor drivers were in, I was finally able to get my hands dirty with testing. I haven't worked with drivers before so the only goal for today was to see if I can them them running with the limited supply of voltage. Batteries didn't have the voltage required and the external car battery didn't have the required current to produce motor speed. I was able to debug this with the nema 17 stepper motor and the DRV8825 driver. You can hear the gears humming inside, but it couldn't spin.
